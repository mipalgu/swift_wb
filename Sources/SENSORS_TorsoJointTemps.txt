@brief Temp class for various joints
From Nao Docs: There are two different Devices that return a temperature: the MotorBoard, and the Battery. For both, the temperature returned in “Value” is in deg Celsius. The motor temperature is a simulated one, using electric current value of the motor. Even when the robot just starts, the temperature is quite high (50°C).The simulation starts at this value mainly due to the internal temperature value. The motor board implements a temperature limitation: as long as the simulated temperature reaches 75°C, the current limitation is decreased to stay under 85°C.
